<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I'm a backend programmer with a passion for writing tools to make it easier
for my colleagues to do their work. My favorite projects to build are ones
where my work improves everyone's lives without them really even noticing. I
have a lot of experience changing the wings while the plane is in flight, and
take pride in my ability to design and deploy software that solves problems
elegantly and maintainably.</p>

<h3>Selected Publicly Available Work</h3>
  <div class="cv-content">

<p>Most of my professional programming output is work internal to Fastmail.
This list is things a few open-source I've done there, plus various projects
in other languages.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/fastmail/mint-tag">mint-tag</a>
        <ul>
            <li>mint-tag performs git arcana to build deployable artifacts

        <ul>
            <li>Synergy is Fastmail's Slack bot; it contains API clients for
                many external services (Slack, of course, but also GitLab,
                PagerDuty, Zendesk, and many others)</li>
            <li>my role: one of two primary developers</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/fastmail/Ix">Ix</a>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/mmcclimon/pidgit">pidgit</a>
        <ul>
            <li>pidgit was an early pandemic project; it's a reimplementation
                (incomplete) of git in Rust, to learn both rust and git</li>
            <li>my role: sole author</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Synergy clones:<br>this is my preferred language-learning
        project, because there are a lot of things to get up and running to
        make it go (websockets, HTTP APIs, asynchronous programming, and so
        on). I've written a few:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/mmcclimon/synergy-js">synergy-js</a> (TypeScript)</li>
