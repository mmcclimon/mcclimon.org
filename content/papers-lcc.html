<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>It is difficult to overstate the influence of George Russell’s <i>Lydian
Chromatic Concept</i> on jazz pedagogy; he has been called the first jazz
theorist, and the book has been praised as “the foremost theoretical
contribution” of its time. And yet, the <i>Concept</i> has been largely
ignored in recent music-theoretical scholarship on jazz. This paper considers
why, by examining Russell and the <i>Concept</i> from a historical
perspective.</p>

<p>Russell’s work in the <i>Concept</i> can be divided into two components:
chord-scale equivalence and Lydian generation. The former has taken a strong
hold in teaching improvisation; the idea that a scale can stand in for a chord
symbol was groundbreaking, and seems so obvious in retrospect that many
authors today do not even credit Russell with the idea. This equivalence grows
out of the more fundamental theory (indeed, the Concept itself) that the
Lydian mode is the principal organizing force of all tonal music. This idea is
more controversial and has not taken hold in the same way. But of course,
theorists are used to adopting worthwhile theoretical ideas from authors
without assuming their entire worldview.</p>

<p>By reconsidering Russell historically, we can begin to understand why parts
of his idiosyncratic theory have flourished while others seem to have fallen
by the wayside. The paper begins by briefly outlining Russell’s contributions,
tracing their adoption, and then considers what we might gain by
reincorporating some of his original intention of the <i>Concept</i> into
modern scholarship.</p>
