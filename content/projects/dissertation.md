## Abstract


Harmony is one of the most fundamental elements of jazz, and one that is often
taken for granted in the scholarly literature. Because jazz is an improvised
music, its harmony is more fluid and potentially more complex than that of
other, notated traditions. Harmony in common-practice jazz (c. 1940--1965) is
typically represented by chord symbols, which can be actualized by performers
in any number of ways, and which might change over the course of a single
performance.

This dissertation presents a transformational model of jazz harmony that helps
to explain this inherent complexity. While other theories of jazz harmony
require transcriptions into notation, the transformational approach enables
analysis of chord symbols themselves. This approach, in which chord symbols
are treated as first-class objects, is consistent with the way jazz harmony is
usually taught, and with the way jazz musicians usually discuss harmony.
Though transformational theory has been applied to later jazz, the aim of this
study is rather different: the music under consideration here might be called
"tonal jazz," in which functional harmonic progressions are still the rule.

After a general introduction, the first chapter introduces the
transformational approach by developing a diatonic seventh-chord space.
Chapter 2 expands this diatonic space to a fully chromatic space that focuses
on the ii--V--I progression, laying the foundation for much of the work that
follows. Chapter 3 extends the model to examine music in which root motion by
thirds plays an important role, paying special attention to the way in which
harmonic substitution interacts with more normative jazz harmony. Since the
pioneering work of George Russell in the 1950s, many jazz musicians have drawn
an equivalence between chords and scales; Chapter 4 develops a
transformational approach to these chord-scales, enabling analyses of
improvisations on tunes first analyzed in the preceding chapters. The final
chapter centers on a single harmonic archetype, Rhythm changes, and brings
together the theoretical framework in a series of analyses featuring solos by
Johnny Griffin, Thelonious Monk, George Coleman, Sonny Rollins, and Sonny
Stitt.
