<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The 1957 album <i>Sonny Side Up</i> is widely regarded as one of the best “jam
session” albums in recorded jazz, and on no track is the cutting session
between Sonny Rollins and Sonny Stitt more pronounced than on Stitt’s “The
Eternal Triangle.” This is a Rhythm changes tune, and provides a wealth of
opportunity for the study of interaction, both with the form itself and
between the two tenor saxophonists.</p>

<p>After a brief analysis of the tune, this talk examines the twenty choruses of
saxophone solos in more detail, showing how suggestions of outside playing in
Rollins’s first six choruses are more fully realized when he and Stitt begin
trading fours and eights after Stitt’s solo choruses. Drawing on models of
interaction from Robert Hodson and Garrett Michaelsen, as well as a
transformational model for chord-scales developed in my own dissertation, I
examine interaction between the harmony as expressed by the two soloists and
the rest of the ensemble, and how it relates to the larger genre Rhythm
changes. Finally, the talk shows we might hear a remarkable moment in the
final chorus of trading as arising from a process begun eight minutes earlier.</p>
