Like most people I know, I'm profoundly saddened and disappointed by the
results of this week's presidential election. I have lots of thoughts,
and I'm not 100% sure I'll be able to put them down in words, but I'll
try.

I'm sure nothing I'll write here is anything that hasn't been written
more eloquently elsewhere. My theory friends [Megan](https://meganlavengood.com/2016/11/10/listening/)
and [Bryn](https://bloghughes.blogspot.com/2016/11/post-election-fog.html)
have both written excellent posts on this; Bryn also created a bangin' Spotify
playlist (with some help from his Twitter followers).

I can't say I'm completely shocked by the outcome, though I am
disppointed that the polling numbers seemed to have been misleading.
Maybe this is pessimism from living in a deeply red state and driving by
a dozen Trump/Pence signs a day, or maybe I've just learned never to
underestimate angry white people who feel threatened by people of other
cultures. I'm as guilty as the next liberal of refusing to engage with
my racist/misogynist high-school friends or extended family members on
social media. (But at the same time, social media, and Facebook in
particular, is a terrible place for substantive discussion with people
you disagree with.)

There are a lot of things to be sad and angry about. With Trump in the
White House, a Republican Congress, and (at least) one seat to fill in
the Supreme Court, social progress in this country could be set back
decades in no time flat. As a heterosexual white male, I'm mostly immune
from the primary effects of that---straight white dudes have been in
power basically forever in this country, after all---and, as I saw
somewhere on Twitter, even though I disagree with everything about the
next administration, at least I was born in the right camouflage.

I ache for women. Mike Pence is dangerously anti-woman, and it seems
likely that reproductive rights are going to take a big hit. Even more
than that, though, knowing that our country elected someone who *brags*
about sexual assault over the most qualified candidate of all time is
heart-breaking.

I ache for the LGBTQ community. For my friends, whose marriages are now in
doubt. For my students, who are beginning to form their adult identities
and are now being told that who they are is unacceptable. For the people
I'll never know, who no longer feel safe in their own communities.

I ache for people of color. I'm sad that people who look like me have
been so terrible to you for so long. I'm sad that this election has
brought to the surface the hate you've felt your entire lives. I'm sad
we will have an administration that wants to keep you from coming here,
and to send home your families. I'm sad that people do not understand that
black lives matter. I'm especially sad that the president-elect has
promised to restore "law and order," and that that will involve more
senseless murders of black men and women by the people who are supposed
to be protecting you.

I know it's early still, and that there's work to be done. Already today
we've donated (well...Carolyn has donated, but we share a bank account)
to the NAACP, to Planned Parenthood, and to NARAL Pro-Choice America.
A majority of the country did *not* vote for Donald Trump (not even a
majority of *voters* did), and we cannot stand by and let him and his
administration destroy the things that were so hard-won by people
working much so much harder than I ever will.

In the past, I've tended to be fairly hands-off, politically. I was
raised in a culture in which you did your work, and didn't go telling
everybody about it. (My parents are both very liberal, though probably
no one outside their immediate family knows that.) For me, that's
going to change: if I can't speak up for what I think is right, how is
anything ever supposed to change?
