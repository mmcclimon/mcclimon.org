I'm a music academic by day, and I hardly ever listen to music in my spare
time. (I don't think this is altogether uncommon for our field.) I do have to
spend a fair bit of time in the car, and don't want to ride in silence, and so
I listen to a lot of podcasts. Here are some of my favorites.

<!--more-->

## General

I assume if you're reading a blog on the internet, you've probably heard
of [podcasts][wp-podcast]. I listen to them on my phone
using [Overcast][overcast], which I highly recommend! Most of the podcasts I
listen to are just people talking about things they find interesting. To me it
doesn't really matter what they're talking about: I could basically listen
to anyone talk for hours about something they're _super_ into.

## Must-listens

Some episodes are instant listens: they jump to the top of the list when
there's a new episode.

__[Hello Internet][hi]__. This is a two-dudes-talking podcast with two
YouTubers: [Brady Haran][brady] and [CGP Grey][grey]. Presumably they talk
about making a living on the internet, but really they talk about whatever
they want.[^1]

__[Cortex][cortex]__. Another two-dudes-talking podcast, with Grey (again) and
[Myke Hurley][myke]. Here they talk mostly about productivity and business-y
things. I came to this one before Hello Internet, and found Grey to be an
interesting guy.

__[Reconcilable Differences][rd]__. Yet another two-dudes-talking format, this
time with [Merlin Mann][merlin] and [John Siracusa][siracusa]. I'm still
working my way through the back catalog on this one, so I've listened to a
*lot* of this lately. They talk about various nerd-related topics. I find John
to be a fascinating guy as well.

## Usual-listens

These are shows for which I listen to almost every episode, though I'm not as
diligent about catching them when they first come out.

__[Comedy Bang Bang!][cbb]__ This is a comedy/improv show, hosted by Scott
Aukerman. I really like this one, although it's definitely not for everyone.
Usually Scott has a number of guests on: one real person, and one or more
improv characters. Scott always plays the straight man, which gives the improv
bits grounding that I usually find missing in these kind of shows. If there's
one of these with Paul F. Tompkins, it jumps to the must-listen list.

__[This American Life][tal]__. A weekly NPR show that everyone knows. Like
every other middle-class left-leaning white dude, I like this show too, though
it can occasionally be a little too earnest. (I'm behind on this one since the
election.)

__[The Paceline][paceline]__. This is a cycling podcast...if you have no
interest in cycling, you can ignore this one. If you do, it's the best one
I've found. It's a three-dudes-talking podcast: Michael Hotten, Patrick Brady
(both of [Red Kite Prayer][rkp]) and Fatty (whose real name I don't know
offhand), formerly of [Fat Cyclist][fc]. (Though they announced this week that
Fatty is being folded into the RKP family.)

__[Lexicon Valley][lv]__. This is a Slate podcast all about linguistics (a
favorite topic of mine), hosted by [John McWhorter][jm]. I happened on this
one recently (via RecDiffs), but I'm a fan so far.

__[Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People][beautiful-anonymous]__. Hosted by
[Chris Gethard][geth], this is a show where random people call in and talk to
Chris on the phone about whatever they want. I like this one a lot, though I'm
behind: a lot of the callers seem to be slightly-unhappy people in their
mid-20s.

__[The Pen Addict][penaddict]__. Two dudes ([Brad Dowdy][dowdy] and Myke
Hurley), talking about pens. I like this show a lot, though I'm getting
foundered on it a little bit.[^2] This show is how I happened upon Myke and
his company [Relay FM][relay], which opened the door to Cortex, HI, RecDiffs,
and lots of others.

__[Back to Work][b2w]__. Merlin Mann and [Dan Benjamin][dan], talking,
nominally (but not really) about productivity. I happened on this one via
RecDiffs, and like it pretty well too.

## Once-listened-to

There is a whole other set of podcasts I used to listen to, or listen to only very
occasionally.

__[WTF][wtf]__. Everyone knows this show: it's [Marc Maron][maron] talking to
famous people in his garage. I listen if there's someone I really like on. If
you haven't heard his show with Barack Obama, you should listen.

__[Penn's Sunday School][pss]__. Hosted by Penn Jillette (of Penn & Teller)
and his friends. I used to like this show a lot, but I sort of stopped
listening when they started talking about weight loss all the time.

__[Serial][serial]__. Everyone listened to Season 1 of this show; the second
season was *meh*. I'll listen again when a new season comes out.

__[Nerd Poker][np]__. This was a Dungeons & Dragons podcast
with [Brian Posehn][posehn] and some of his friends. I listened to the first
campaign (episodes 1--73), which was great (if you like D&D). It's now
defunct, and I haven't listened to anything after Episode 73.

__[With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus][lapkus]__. Another improv podcast:
Lauren's a frequent guest on Comedy Bang Bang, and I listen to her show
occasionally. Sometimes long-form improv makes me tired, so it's not a regular
listen for me (though Lauren is very funny).

__[Welcome to Night Vale][nightvale]__. A Lovecraftian fiction podcast about a
fictional desert town. I listened to the first season of this and haven't
returned, though I keep meaning to.

## Fin

I'm tired of typing now. I'll listen to one-offs of other shows, if someone
tells me I should. This covers most of them, though. If there are others I
should know about, [let me know on Twitter](//twitter.com/mmcclimon)!

[^1]: Fun fact: Carolyn _really_ hates this podcast, because she listened to the most boring episode of all time (if you don't follow the show) on a long trip to Indiana a year ago. I definitely wouldn't start with Ep. 56, "Two Dudes Counting."
[^2]: founder (v.) -- to grow tired of. This is a usage that I think is exclusive to my father and his family, but that I keep around. If you "get foundered" on something, usually it's something you used to really like but you've had too much of it and so it's getting a little old.
