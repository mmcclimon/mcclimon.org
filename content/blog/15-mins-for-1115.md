I've been reading Anne Lamott's *Bird by Bird*, which came recommended as a
book on writing over a period of months by several random people on the
internet. I'm only a few chapters in, but it seems good so far; one of the
things she suggests (like everyone else who has written a book on writing) is
to do it every day, no matter what. So here is mine for today.

I've been thinking a lot today about to-do apps. This is partly because it's
now getting to be the time in the semester when I have a million things piling
up and seemingly very little time to actually do them. Of course, when I
write them all down, that's not actually true. One of the first steps I take
when I'm feeling overwhelemed is to write down *everything* that needs to be
done. Today, that entailed all school activities until the end of the
semester: grading, writing assignments, giving exams, and so on.

Usually my to-dos are scrawled on 8 different notepads in three different
places---a system I'm not at all opposed to. I also use a few different to-do
applications on my phone: [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/)
and [Swipes](http://swipesapp.com/personal/). (I have also
used [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), and today downloaded
and quickly
deleted [Wunderlist](http://wunderlist.com/), [Todoist](https://todoist.com/),
and [Any.do](https://www.any.do/).)

Here are the things I want in a to-do app:

- The ability to schedule tasks to start later. What I want is to be able to
  put a whole bunch of things in and not see any of them until I need to.
  (2Do is perfect for this.) In my case, I want to put in a bunch of deadlines
  for grading homework assignments, and not see them until I actually get the
  homework assignments in from students.

- A badge icon that displays only things I can do _right now_. This is
  something that Swipes is pretty good at: if I have a task set to start at
  7:00 pm (usually the case with my "clean the litter box" task), I don't want
  a red badge staring at me all day.

- Location-awareness. This is something that a lot of to-do apps seem to have,
  _sort of_. In a perfect world, I want the app to remind me at 7:00 to clean
  the litter box, but _only_ if I'm at home. Often I'm out of the house at
  7:00, but I don't want to see the red badge of shame if I can't deal with
  it.

You know, I thought there were more things than this, but that might actually
be all. 2Do is pretty great, but the second point is killer for me: I used to
have a recurring task to clean the litter box, but that damn red badge would
stare at me all day long. I want the badge there to remind me to do something,
but not if I can't actually do it!

(Aside: from this post, it seems like the only tasks I ever have are to grade
homeworks and clean the litter box. Come to think of it, that's not too far
from the truth. But, these are two tasks where checklist-style to-do apps seem
to fail me, and so they're always the first things I try with a new app.)


We're now at that critical point in the semester where it *seems* like we just
had midterms, but now all of a sudden we're staring into the face of final
projects, exams, and all of their attendant grading. Plus what is one of the
most useless weeks of teaching: the week after Thanksgiving before exams. But
that's a topic for another day...my 15 minutes are up.
