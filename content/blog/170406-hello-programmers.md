title: A new job at Pobox
tags: [news, life]
---

I'm taking a Perl development job at [Pobox][pobox], and joining the Perl
community after a long time lurking in the shadows. Details after the jump.

## Who am I?

(If you're a music theorist or some other kind of academic, you might find
[this other post about leaving academia][academia] more interesting.)

My name is Michael McClimon; my education is all in music theory but I've been
programming as a hobby and side job since graduate school. Perl is my first
love when it comes to programming languages: I first learned it in grad school
as a way of getting out of taking French.[^1] I've been involved with
programming on the side in a handful of music-related projects: I've done
things for [<em>Music Theory Online</em>][mto],
the [Society for Music Theory][smt], Indiana
University's [Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature][chmtl],
and a handful of other things too.

I've spent the last few years at my alma mater, [Furman University][furman],
teaching music theory. Even still, I've kept an eye out for interesting programming
jobs, so when the Pobox job came open at the beginning of March I
jumped on it. I'm really excited, and I'm ready to dive in to a new adventure.

## Pobox

Pobox is an email company, and since 2015 has been a service
of [FastMail][fastmail]. It seems like most people in the tech community have
at least heard of Pobox or of FastMail, and certainly people in the Perl
community are familiar with them. I've used Pobox for my own email for years
now, and recommend them at every chance I get.

When I was working in academia, I always thought that a job like Pobox was my
ideal programming position: their [values][values] line up with mine, they're
a company with a real business model that has been around for longer than six
months, and they use Perl. And not just that, they contribute actively to Perl
development; the technical team at Pobox is headed by the
former [pumpking][pumpking], Rik Signes (rjbs). I saw on Twitter that they'd
posted a job listing, and knew I had to apply.[^2]


## Final thoughts

I've not really been involved with the software or Perl communities, but I'm
ready to start. (All of my previous conference time has been spent with music
theorists!) I'm looking forward to meeting and working with more
people in the programming world, and to start this new chapter in my career.
I'll try to blog more with updates (and may occasionally post some technical
content), though I make no promises. If you want to chat, I'm happy to talk!
The easiest way to find me is either on Twitter ([@mmcclimon][twitter]), or
via my [email address][email], which is proudly hosted on Pobox!



[^1]: I learned Perl in 2011, which is admittedly a little strange, but honestly the O'Reilly Perl books were better than the O'Reilly Python books.
[^2]: I'm perhaps most thankful it was posted in March and not in October, since I can only really leave my teaching job at the end of an academic year!
