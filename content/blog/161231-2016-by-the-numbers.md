As they say on [Marketplace][marketplace], let's do the numbers.

<!--more-->

**1.** Degree earned. My PhD was officially awarded in January of this year.

**2.** Conferences attended. Music Theory Southeast (at Kennesaw State, in
March) and AMS/SMT in Vancouver.

**4.** Countries visited. Canada (see above), plus a European adventure with
Carolyn in June, featuring Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

**20.** Books read. See them all [here][goodreads].

**~35.** Complete listens of one of the Schubert song cycles.

**50.2.** Longest bike ride of the year, in miles. See it [here][strava].

**53.** Individual students taught.

**~250.** Podcasts listened to. (A *very* rough guess.)

**366.** New York Times daily crossword completions. (And I only blatantly
cheated on one, when I flew to Germany and almost broke my streak.)

**~1000.** Papers graded. I *really* don't want to know this actual number.

**1455.** Miles on the bicycle. (This figure is probably low.) That's over
about 116 hours, and with a total elevation gain of roughly 2 Mt. Everests.

2016 was a pretty lousy year in a lot of respects, but here's to a new one.
