If there's one thing I do a lot of in all of my hats (student, programmer,
music theorist), it's sitting in front of a computer, typing. I've been
thinking a lot lately about the act of typing, primarily because I've gotten
some rather annoying pain in my left hand that I've been trying to get rid of.
Behind the jump, some collected thoughts on typing: equipment, technique, and
why I've been thinking so much about it.

## Equipment

When I started working at [CHMTL](//chmtl.indiana.edu), I found an old
[IBM Model M](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M) keyboard in the desk. You
probably remember them from the early 90s...I learned to type on one in
elementary school. Some time around February I bought an adapter and started
to use it at work. I really enjoyed the tactile thunk of the keys when you
pressed them, and that high-pitched ping the buckling spring makes when it
hits the side of the tube. (I don't think my colleagues in the basement of the
library appreciated it as much as I did, however.)

Some time after that, I stumbled into the world of mechanical keyboards, and
realized that they're experiencing something of a comeback. A company, Cherry
MX, has started making mechanical key switches in several different varieties
(see a [comparison](http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide),
if you're into that sort of thing). I had a small unexpected windfall over
spring break, and decided to spring for a mechanical keyboard of my very own.
It's a custom from [WASD Keyboards](//wasdkeyboards.com), with Cherry brown
switches:

I really like the feel of the mechanical switches: you get a distinctive bump
(with the browns, at least) when the switch actuates. There's no mushy feeling
that a lot of keyboards have, and I'm actually know when I press a key
(something that often frustrates me with Apple scissor-switch style
keyboards). In an effort to stem my left hand/wrist problems, I also recently
got a [Vortex Poker II](//mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=459)
to use at work:

Mechanical keyboards tend to be much more expensive than their membrane or
scissor-switch counterparts, unfortunately. I spend a lot of time typing,
however, and I've started to go by the
[comfort principle](http://lifehacker.com/5857142/the-comfort-principle-spend-money-where-you-spend-your-time):
spend your money where you spend your time. If I spend ~8 hours a day (a low
estimate, for many days) in front of a computer, a keyboard easily pays for
itself in a month's time or so.

## Technique

This is not a post about learning to touch-type. I did that at a very young
age, and it's in my blood: my granddad operated teletype machines during WWII,
and he could bang out some text on a typewriter like nobody's business. As
[Steve Yegge notes](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html),
however, it's lazy to spend hours in front of a computer every day and not
learn to type. In programming and music theory alike, most of my work consists
of thinking, with frantic typing breaks in between to get my thoughts down "on
paper," so to speak. When this happens it's crucial to get the thought into
the machine as quickly as possible so that the thought doesn't escape. (I
could write a lot more here about the cybernetic implications of "putting
thoughts into the machine," or why I love Vim, but those are posts for another
day.)

A while back, I read Steve Losh's excellent [Modern Space
Cadet](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/) post, and I've
done some of his modifications. In particular, mapping Caps Lock to Escape
(when pressed alone) and Control (when pressed with something else) has
changed my typing life, especially in editors where I need to type those
characters a lot. More importantly though, his post made me realize that I was
using the wrong Shift keys: essentially I only ever used the left shift, which
meant that I was contorting my hand into unnatural shapes whenever I needed to
type a `Q` or a `~`:

## The Ways of the Hand

Thinking so much about my typing has reminded me of David Sudnow's [Ways of
the Hand](http://www.amazon.com/Ways-Hand-David-Sudnow/dp/0262691612), in
which he gives an extraordinarily detailed account of learning to play jazz
piano. He writes about first having to think consciously about every motion,
coaxing his hands to land in the right places, and only later getting to the
point where he can just think of a musical line and his hands do what's right.

Though I'm long past the point of having to think where a given key is on my
keyboard, thinking about typing has made me hyper-aware of things I do that
are a bit unusual. For example, I always hit the backspace key with my ring
finger, despite the fact that it makes me reach awkwardly to do so. I've tried
to train myself to force my pinky to do it, but it's not quite so easy as the
shift key problem to solve: the software can't tell which finger the key is
pressed with.

I've also been periodically doing something that [Phil
Ford](//dialmformusicology.com) suggested once in class of his I took last
spring, which is to try to type without stopping for some length of time (a
minute or two). What I've noticed is that I often realize when I've made some
mistake---transposed two characters, what have you---but that it doesn't
register until I'm well past it. There is just a disturbance in the flow, if
you will, and only a split-second later I realize that I've typed "acutal"
instead of "actual" once again. Writing mostly in a text editor makes this
more apparent, since I can turn spellchecking off easily and it doesn't try to
"correct" things unless I tell it to explicitly.

It seems to me there is something Heisenbergian about typing: the act of
observing it changes our relationship to it. Maybe typing is where [hip is
headed next](http://www.amazon.com/Dig-Sound-Music-Hip-Culture/dp/0199939918).
