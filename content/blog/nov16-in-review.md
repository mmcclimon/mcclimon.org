It seems like the end of the month is as good a time as any to take a look
back to see what's happened. Especially since this rebirth of the blog
happened about a month ago.

<!--more-->

The biggest happening of the month was
my [trip to Vancouver](/blog/smt-2016/). Big trips like that always loom
large, since it kills basically three weeks of the calendar: the week before
is spent preparing; you miss the 5 days of actual travel; and the week after
is spent catching up.

Actually, I take that back. The biggest happening of the month was
certainly [the election](/blog/election-thoughts/). I have no more coherent
thoughts about that, other than holding out hope that things won't turn out as
badly as they seem like they could be at the moment.

Quick updates on more run-of-the-mill things:

- Reading. I'm still (slowly) working on Anne Lamott's _Bird by Bird_. I
  usually get more reading done when school's out of session; here's looking
  forward to that.
- Writing. Oof...I've written lots of cover letters; does that count? I have
  some writing I'm thinking of revisiting, but all of the regional theory
  conferences are far away from this year. (Looking at you, Music Theory
  Southeast in Ft. Myers, Florida.)
- Teaching. As I said last time, the semester is coming to a close, like it or
  not. I have grand plans to rework next semester's course, so we'll see about
  that once this one is officially in the books.
- Contract work. I don't think I've written about this here (and won't now
  either, really), but I'm doing some work for Norton publishing (digital
  learning things). I sent off another chunk of that today, so we'll see what
  they say.
- Cycling. I need to write a real post about cycling, but my November was
  pathetic: only 38 miles in total. I'm going to chalk part of that up to SMT,
  part of it up to being busier than usual, and part up to the fact that I
  don't have appropriate clothing for cooler weather. (Excuses, I know.)
- Computer things. In addition to the work for Norton, I've been working this
  week on the next issue of [MTO](//mtosmt.org), plus some work retrofitting
  older, mathy articles. I also did a bit of tweaking on this site (new
  fonts! footnotes!), and have written a fair bit of other nonsense to make my life
  easier: a minor mode for [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)[^1] for
  editing MTO files, and some random Perl for munging SVG data for Norton.

Looking forward to December, the biggest things coming up are (a) the end of
the semester; (b) my birthday[^2]; and \(c) Christmas traveling. And with any
luck, some more writing here.
