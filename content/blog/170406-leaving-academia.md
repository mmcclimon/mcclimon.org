title: I'm leaving academia (for now)
tags: [news, life]
---

Short version: I'm taking a job at [Pobox][pobox] doing software development,
and moving to Philadelphia after the semester ends. I'm not giving up on music
or music theory, but I won't be teaching next year. Details after the jump.

## Backstory

I think most of the people that read this blog are music theorists or people
that know me personally. If that's not you and instead you're a programmer
that's found themselves here, you might find [this other post more enlightening][programming].

I have a PhD in music theory.[^1] While I was doing my PhD, I happened into
programming as a way of getting out of taking French. (At Indiana, you can
take either two foreign languages or a foreign language and a research skill,
and my knowing computers is much more useful than my knowing French.) This has
led to any number of side gigs: I've done various music-related programming
things for [<em>Music Theory Online</em>][mto],
the [SMT][smt], [CHMTL][chmtl], and a handful of others, and it helped pay the
bills in grad school.

I've always kept one eye open for interesting programming jobs, and so when
this job came open at the beginning of March I jumped on it. (Yes, academics,
you read that correctly: I applied for the job in the second week of March and
accepted it the first week of April. On the same day I accepted, I got a
rejection letter for an academic job I'd applied to in September.) I'm really
excited, and I'm ready to dive in to a new adventure.

## FAQs

(This is an announcment post, so no one has actually *asked* any questions,
but these are questions I can imagine people having.)

__What is Pobox?__ Pobox is an email company; I've been using them for my
personal email for years. As of 2015, they are a service
of [FastMail][fastmail], which is another great email company headquartered in
Melbourne, Australia.

__Why did you want to work for Pobox?__ My favorite programming language
is [Perl][perl]. In learning Perl a while back, I learned that Pobox used
Perl, and in fact contributes a lot to Perl development.[^2] When I started
to consider looking for programming jobs, I had always thought "My ideal
programming job would be something like Pobox," and as it turns out that's
come to pass. Pobox and FastMail's [values][values] also match really closely
with my own, and all the people seem really great. (There are a lot of other
reasons too, but that might be another post.)

__Don't you like music theory?__ I sure do! I spent a long time in school for
it. I also really like programming. If I'd discovered it earlier, I might have
wound up here sooner.

__Do you regret getting a PhD in music theory?__ Thankfully, not at all. I
didn't go into debt to get the degree, and without it I probably never would
have happened into programming in the first place. I have lots of close
friends I met through theory, and music theory has paid the bills for nearly a
decade now.

__Are you leaving teaching forever?__ I'm not sure. I'm leaving it for now. If
it turns out I can live a happy, fulfilling life without teaching chromatic
harmony, then great!

__Are you leaving academia entirely?__ No! I'm going to keep up my work with
MTO and SMT, and I'm planning to go to this year's SMT meeting in Alexandria
(especially since it will be close!). I'd still like to do some research,
though I'll probably take a break for a bit while I get used to my new life.

__Wait, didn't you just publish an article?__ I did, last week! You
can find it here: [Transformations in Tonal Jazz][article].[^3]

__Are you just doing this because you couldn't find an academic job?__ No.
Although the academic job market can be pretty dismal[^4], as I mentioned
above, I've always kept an eye out for interesting opportunities elsewhere.
What I really love (and am good at, I think) is learning new things:
programming offers a lot of new things to learn, and Pobox in particular
offers a lot of opportunity for learning more about the field, while
contributing to it at the same time.


## Final thoughts

I'm excited to start a new chapter in my career and in our life.[^5] We don't
yet have all of the logistics worked out (especially moving again with a blind
cat), and there is lots to do between now and the end of the semester. If you
have more questions, I'm happy to talk! The easiest way to find me is either
on Twitter ([@mmcclimon][twitter]), or via my [email address][email], which is
proudly hosted on Pobox!




[^1]: Actually, I have three degrees in music theory. My standard first-day-of-class joke is that qualifies me to do very little other than teach music theory to other people. As it turns out, that's not *entirely* true.
[^2]: The erstwhile [pumpking][pumpking], Rik Signes (rjbs), is the person who hired me.
[^3]: This is more of a plug than a real question, I know.
[^4]: You knew that already.
[^5]: One more FAQ. Thankfully, the job pays enough so that Carolyn won't have to do part-time adjunct work; she's going to focus on writing her dissertation.
