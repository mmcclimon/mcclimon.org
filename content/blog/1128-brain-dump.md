It's happened again: every time I try to start (or restart) a blog, I go at it
pretty well for a few days, at which point it lies fallow. It's not that I've
forgotten the blog exists&nbsp;-- rather, I just feel like I shouldn't post
anything if I don't have anything to say. But that's a self-defeating
attitude, so here's a post with nothing in particular at all to say.

It's now my least favorite time in the semester: the week after Thanksgiving
but before finals. As of this evening, there are 6 more days of class left.
There is still new material to cover, but nobody (teachers included) really
wants to do it. This is one of the many reasons I'm in favor of Adam Kotsko's
suggestion to
[adopt Canadian Thanksgiving instead](https://itself.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/the-trouble-with-thanksgiving/).

But, that means it's almost the semester break. The academic calendar can be
brutal, in that much of the work is concentrated into very small chunks of
time. But as my friend Garrett once enlightened me, that's a much better
system than the constant, daily grind of a stereotypical office job.


Because it's the end of the semester and I'm pretty busy, I've been playing
around with different productivity systems. ("Productivity system" is such a
terrible phrase, but I don't know what else to call them.) I am currently
working on a lot of different things, and all of them have different
deadlines, and I don't want to drop any balls.[^1] Right now I'm using a
combination of [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) and
Emacs [org-mode](//orgmode.org), which seems to be okay for now. I'll spare
you the gory details.

I'm spending a lot of time applying for jobs. I think that's all that needs to
be said about that.

I've been thinking that I should read more, but then again, that's often
something I'm thinking. When push comes to shove, though, I almost always pick
sitting on the couch watching TV over reading. To that end, though, here are
some things we've watched recently:

- *Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life*. ★★★★☆ -- not a fan of the ending.
- *Search Party*. ★★★★☆ -- pretty entertaining, and easy to binge.
- *Kroll Show*. ★★★★★ -- a rewatch...such a great show.

That'll be all for today. Next project: figure out footnote formatting here.

[^1]: A juggling metaphor! It's been way too long since I've taken a deep dive
    into juggling YouTube videos. But for now,
