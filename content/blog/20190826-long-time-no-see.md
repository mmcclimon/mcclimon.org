I sort of forgot I had this blog. Well, "forgot" isn't quite right; I knew it
was still _here_, but had been actively ignoring it. I suspect its readership
has not actually changed at all in its dormancy. It's possible I'll start
writing it in again, though by now I suspect that fully half of all the posts
are meta-commentary on the blog itself.

I started to write a list of all the things that have happened in the 16
months since I've written here, but that was boring to write and would
certainly have been boring to read, too. So instead, I'll use this space to
tell you that [JMAP](//jmap.io) has now been officially released, as RFCs
[8620](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8620) (core) and
[8621](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8621) (mail). I wasn't really involved
with their authorship, but my colleagues at Fastmail were, and we have all
been working on implementing JMAP internally.

Maybe, as a foray back into writing a bit here, I'll do a series of posts
about what JMAP is, why we wrote it, and why we like it so much. Next time!
