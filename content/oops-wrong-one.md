# Lives that are not mine

If you've landed here, you are probably in the wrong place. Despite having a
very uncommon name, I have occasionally been confused for other people.

- I am not a financial advisor in Iowa. I did get an email once inviting me to
  the Des Moines CEO club, but I declined and said that driving through Des
  Moines exactly once probably did not qualify me to do so.
- I do not run a [ragtime band](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/032003/cover0320.html)
  in Humboldt County, California. Though to be fair, if you confused me with
  someone that was soft-spoken and spoke passionately about jazz, you could be
  forgiven.
- I am not, by any account, a [blockchain engineer](https://github.com/michaelmcclimon/),
  even though [Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/).

me at <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">Dennis Ritchie's page</a>) that is the inspiration for this one.)
